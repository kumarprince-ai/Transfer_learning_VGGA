# Transfer_learning_VGGA
The VGG16 model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that was trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains over 1.2 million images of 1000 different categories. After training, the VGG16 model can achieve an accuracy of over 90% on the ImageNet classification task.


# VGG16 Image Classification with TensorFlow/Keras

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script for performing image classification using the VGG16 model with TensorFlow/Keras. The VGG16 model is a popular pre-trained deep learning model that can classify objects in images.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.7 or higher)
- TensorFlow (2.x)
- Keras
- Jupyter Notebook (if running in a Jupyter environment)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras jupyter
Usage
Clone this repository or download the Python script (vgg16_image_classification.py) to your local machine.

Ensure you have an image you want to classify. Replace img_path in the script with the path to your image.

Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python vgg16_image_classification.py
The script will load the VGG16 model, preprocess your image, make predictions, and display the top 5 predicted classes along with their scores.

Example
Here's an example of what the script does:

1: Persian_cat (0.45)
2: Siamese_cat (0.30)
3: lynx (0.10)
4: tabby (0.05)
5: Egyptian_cat (0.03)
